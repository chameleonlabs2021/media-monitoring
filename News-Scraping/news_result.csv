                            Amnesty International has uncovered “systemic” cases of child labour and labour rights abuses in Indonesian palm oil plantations operated by Wilmar, tracing the palm oil back to firms including Nestlé, Unilever and Kellogg – companies that all claim to source palm oil sustainably.
        








The NGO interviewed 120 workers on palm plantations owned by two subsidiaries of Wilmar and three suppliers located in Kalimantan and Sumatra, Indonesia.The report, The great palm oil scandal: Labour abuses behind big brand names​​, outlines cases of children as young as eight doing physical work without safety equipment and carrying sacks of palm fruit that can weigh between 12 and 25 kg.  Some said they had dropped out of school to help their parents on the plantations.The report claims workers on Wilmar operations were also forced to work long hours or risk having their pay docked and were paid below the minimum wage for the Indonesian province in question – some received as little as US$2.50 per day.Others were said to have suffered severe injuries from using paraquat, a pesticide that is banned in the EU and by Wilmar itself due to toxicity.Amnesty International traced Wilmar’s palm oil back to nine global firms: ADM, Kellogg’s, Nestlé, Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Elevance, AFAMSA, Procter & Gamble and Reckitt Benckiser.Ongoing issuesSingapore-based agri-giant Wilmar is the largest processor and merchandiser of palm and lauric oils in the world. It welcomed the report for helping to highlight labour issues within the wider palm oil industry and in Indonesia specifically.Just under half (45%) of the world’s palm oil comes from Indonesia and the sector employs three million workers.“​Wilmar has put a lot of effort and systems in place to deal with labour and social issues in our operations and supply chain. We acknowledge that there are ongoing labour issues in the palm oil industry, and these issues could affect any palm company operating in Indonesia,” ​said a statement by the company.​​Its 2015 sustainability report identified a need to improve monitoring and enforcing its labour commitments, and this would continue to be refined, it said.It also began working with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) to address some of the issues​​ before publication of the report.Paper promises​However, the report is bad news for RSPO. In addition to Wilmar, three of the five palm growers and eight of the nine food and personal care manufacturers mentioned in the report are RSPO-certified.These manufacturers make claims of sustainable palm oil on their websites or product packaging.Meghna Abraham, senior investigator at Amnesty International said: “Corporate giants like Colgate, Nestlé and Unilever assure consumers that their products use ‘sustainable palm oil’, but our findings reveal that the palm oil is anything but. There is nothing sustainable about palm oil that is produced using child labour and forced labour. ​“The abuses discovered within Wilmar’s palm oil operations are not isolated incidents but are systemic and a predictable result of the way Wilmar does business. ​Something is wrong when nine companies turning over a combined revenue of $325 billion (€306bn) in 2015 are unable to do something about the atrocious treatment of palm oil workers earning a pittance.”​Using RSPO 'as a shield'​According to Seema Joshi, head of business and human rights at Amnesty International, these manufacturers are using RSPO as “a shield to deflect greater scrutiny​”.Although the firms have strong sustainability policies on paper none could demonstrate that they had identified obvious risks of abuses in Wilmar’s supply chain, she said.Only two of the companies, Kellogg and Reckitt Benckiser, offered information on which products could contain Wilmar palm oil.Mondelez refused to confirm if it had sourced or currently sources Indonesian palm oil from Wilmar either directly or indirectly, instead giving information about its broad engagement with suppliers and its in-house palm oil action plan, the report says.However, Amnesty International points to information in the public domain which suggests that the company purchased palm oil from Wilmar in 2013.Traceability troublesMeanwhile, the report says that apart from ADM, which has made public its traceability data, the companies are staying tight-lipped on the source of their palm oil, be it from refineries, mills or plantations.“​Without publicly disclosing this information, the buyers, other than ADM, are not acting in the public interest and interests of the ethical consumer. They claim to the public that their products use certified or sustainable palm, but their refusal to put traceability ​information into the public domain is ensuring that no one can verify their claims,”​ reads the report.“This lack of transparency by companies obstructs the ability of consumers, environmental and human rights groups to check if the products are made using ‘sustainable’ palm oil. This in turn denies the individual consumer the opportunity to seek verification about the products they purchase, and interferes with their ability to make informed choices.”​A statement made by Nestlé said Wilmar supplies around 10% of its total palm oil. ""We are working closely with the company to improve traceability. Now, 83% of the volume that we purchase is traceable back to the mill of origin and 11% is traceable to plantation. This traceability does not yet extend to the plantations at the centre of the allegations in Amnesty International’s report.”​Nestlé added that suppliers that fail to meet the provisions in its Supplier Code, including on labour rights, will be suspended, although it did not comment specifically on whether it planned to suspend Wilmar.Kellogg said in a statement it is committed to working with our global suppliers to source fully traceable palm oil to known and certified sources that are environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable.“If we find, or are made aware of, any supply chain violations of our global palm oil principles, we work with the supplier to understand corrective actions and ensure they understand our commitments. If the concerns are not adequately addressed, we take action to remove them from our supply chain.”​To read all the companies’ letters of response to Amnesty International click here​.​What is the EU doing?​Europe is the world’s second biggest customer of palm oil and imported palm oil volumes worth €3.4 billion in 2014.The European Parliament’s Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) is currently in the process of debating a draft motion for a resolution​​ on actions the EU can take to make palm oil more sustainable.Its rapporteur, Czech MEP Kateřina Konečná, said all stakeholders – be it the EU, producer countries, private businesses or NGOs - must play a part in resolving these issues affecting the commodity“The Amnesty International report shows us that some businesses related to palm oil are ​not considering issues of sustainability and human rights in their actions and therefore they refuse to take a part in this process,” ​she told us.“If companies are not responsible for their actions and if they don't act in the best interest of our planet and people they should face the consequences.”​Konečná’s draft report was debated by ENVI politicians this week and is expected to go to plenary session in April next year.

Something is wrong when nine companies turning over a combined revenue of £260bn in 2015 are unable to do anything about the atrocious treatment of palm oil workers earning a pittance.”She said allegations of child labour at Wilmar were not “isolated incidents but are systemic and a predictable result of the way Wilmar does business”.In the report, Amnesty alleged that children aged from eight to 14 were carrying out dangerous work without safety equipment, were exposed to toxic pesticides and regularly carried sacks of palm fruit weighing 25kg.One 10-year-old boy, who claims he started working for a Wilmar supplier aged eight, said he gets up at 6am to gather fruit and works every day but Sunday. “I don’t go to school ... I carry the sacks with the loose fruit by myself but can only carry it half full. My hands hurt and my body aches,” he said.View image in fullscreenPalm oil production in Indonesia. Photograph: Amnesty InternationalWhen approached by Amnesty, seven of nine companies admitted that they use palm oil from Wilmar’s Indonesian supply network but only two – Kellogg’s and Reckitt Benckiser – offered any detail about which products were affected.The two companies cited “traceability” as a factor in why they had not been aware of abuses at the plantations supplying them palm oil through Wilmar.“Using mealy mouthed excuses about ‘traceability’ is a total cop-out from those companies,” said Amnesty’s business and human rights programme director, Peter Frankental.“You can be sure that if one of these companies’ products were contaminated and had to be taken off the shelves of supermarkets, they would ensure that they could trace the source to specific plantations.”Wilmar said it was aware of allegations about labour rights abuses before it was contacted by Amnesty and was already taking steps to remedy any failings.Liberia: the growth of a new palm oil frontierRead more“Wilmar has put a lot of effort and systems in place to deal with labour and social issues in our operations and supply chain,” the company said. “We acknowledge that there are ongoing labour issues in the palm oil industry, and these issues could affect any palm company operating in Indonesia.“The focus on Wilmar, as the largest processor and merchandiser of palm and lauric oils worldwide, is often used to draw attention to problems in the wider palm oil industry.”Colgate-Palmolive said: “We are concerned about the specific allegations raised by Amnesty International and will hold Wilmar accountable for addressing any issues.”It said it would “terminate any supplier that fails to address labour and human rights concerns”.A Nestlé spokesperson said: “We will investigate allegations related to our purchasing of palm oil, along with our suppliers.” The company said it was not currently able to trace its products back to the plantations in Amnesty’s report.Kellogg’s said: “If we find ... any supply chain violations of our global palm oil principles, we work with the supplier to understand corrective actions and ensure they understand our commitments. If the concerns are not adequately addressed, we take action to remove them from our supply chain.”Another company, Procter and Gamble, said it had been “working with Wilmar to ensure they can remedy any potential human rights infringements in their supply chain”.Explore more on these topicsChild labourNestléFood & drink industryPalm oilAmnesty InternationalUnileverReckitt BenckisernewsShareReuse this contentComments (…)Sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussionMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It found that the palm oil produced at the sites for the company Wilmar had been sold on to manufacturers that produce items ranging from toothpaste and cosmetics to ice-cream.The report ""will shock any consumer who thinks they are making ethical choices"" when selecting products that claim to use sustainable palm oil, Amnesty senior investigator Meghna Abraham said.""Something is wrong when nine companies turning over a combined revenue of $325bn [£260bn] in 2015 are unable to do something about the atrocious treatment of palm oil workers.""Image source, Amnesty InternationalImage caption, Children aged between eight and 14 are working on plantations in Indonesia, Amnesty saysThe report details children aged between eight and 14 carrying out physical labour on plantations in Indonesia without safety equipment in areas exposed to pesticides.Some of the children had dropped out of school to work with parents, while others worked in the afternoons, at weekends and during holidays, Amnesty said.It added that its investigation had found that some plantation workers were earning as little as $2.50 a day.In response to the report, Wilmar said it had already been carrying out an ""internal assessment"" of its supply practices before being approached by Amnesty.""We acknowledge that there are ongoing labour issues in the palm oil industry, and these issues could affect any palm company operating in Indonesia,"" the company said, adding that the report was welcome as it helped ""highlight labour issues"" within the trade.What do the companies say?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Palm oil can be found in everyday items ranging from peanut butter and chocolate to instant noodlesAmnesty said that seven of the nine companies mentioned in the report had admitted that they bought palm oil through Wilmar's Indonesian operations: Unilever, which produces Knorr soups, Dove cosmetics and Pot Noodles, promised to work with its partners to address ""these deeply concerning social issues""Kellogg's cited ""traceability"" in the supply chain as a contributing factor when failing to identify abuses at the plantations; it said it would talk to its suppliers and cease to use them if concerns were ""not adequately addressed"" Colgate and Nestle told Amnesty that none of the products listed by the organisation contained palm oil linked to Wilmar's Indonesian operationsAmnesty's business and human rights programme director, Peter Frankental, said human rights abuses linked to any supply chain should result in a product being viewed as ""defective"".""Using mealy-mouthed excuses about 'traceability' is a total cop-out from these companies,"" he said. ""You can be sure that if one these companies' products were contaminated and had to be taken off the shelves of supermarkets, they would ensure that they could trace the source to specific plantations.""More on this storyWhy palm oil is used by food companies.

Today Amnesty International has published a damning new report into the practices of major consumer goods multinationals. The human rights NGO unpicks the palm oil supply chain and finds evidence of forced labor, child employment and dangerous working conditions within the palm oil supply chain.

Although the company primarily under investigation is Wilmar, the world’s largest palm oil producer, it is the brand names that this firm suppliers that faces the charity’s opprobrium. Colgate, Nestlé and Unilever all come under heavy criticism for allowing conditions to emerge in their supply chains that many would regard as shocking.
Amnesty International interviewed 120 workers within Wilmar’s plantations, as well as digging deeper into their  suppliers in Indonesia.
""Corporate giants like Colgate, Nestlé and Unilever assure consumers that their products use 'sustainable palm oil', but our findings reveal that the palm oil is anything but,"" noted Meghna Abraham, Senior Investigator at Amnesty International.

""Companies are turning a blind eye to exploitation of workers in their supply chain. Despite promising customers that there will be no exploitation in their palm oil supply chains, big brands continue to profit from appalling abuses.""

Palm oil is a highly versatile product that is estimated to be in half of all consumer products, ranging from toothpaste to shampoo. It is mostly produced in Indonesia, which services over half of global demand.
The palm oil sector is rife with corporate social responsibility issues and is linked to deforestation, where its land-intensive farms denude the Indonesian jungle and deny rare species, such as orangutans, of habitation. It also is an area of alleged worker exploitation.

The Amnesty International report describes a punishing work regime with demanding performance targets. Failure to meet objectives can yield financial deductions. Penalties are levied at the manager’s discretion.
Many laborers, the reporters find, feel compelled to work 10-11 hour-long days, accumulating to exceed the legal maximum of 40-hours per week in Indonesia. Despite this grueling schedule many claim they are paid beneath the legal minimum wage.
The report finds that, such are the pressures under which workers are placed, they enlist their spouses and children to toil unpaid to avoid penalties from the employer. The charity found children as young as eight in employment, many of whom dropped out of school to meet their quota.
One worker was quoted as saying: ““I get the premi [bonus] from the loose fruit that’s why my kids help me. I wouldn’t be able to meet the target … otherwise. … The foreman sees my children helping me. The foreman says it is good that my child is helping me.”
Indonesia bans child labor.
Amnesty International also finds evidence of using paraquat, highly dangerous herbicide.  The chemical is banned in the European Union and Wilmar itself has made commitments to phase out its use.
The report finds that suppliers are still routinely making use of the chemical.
The investigators  found one instance of a worker that was splashed in the face by the chemical, leading to severe injuries.  “I can’t see through the eye. I get headaches in part of my head, when I do, my eye feels really swollen. I still get a bit dizzy”.
These allegations are obviously serious and, if true, highly damaging to the brands concerned.
In a statement to Fairfax Media, Wilmar acknowledge the report’s findings, and urged many within the industry to help combat these issues.
Unilever also welcomed the report, agreeing that more needs to be done in the sector. Nestle also expressed concern and vowed to challenge Wilmar with the presented evidence. Colgate-Palmolive stated that they “prohibit discrimination and child or forced labor”.
The companies concerned are signatories to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, a declared commitment to use sustainable sources of the commodity.  Despite this, and their own independent policies, these major organizations have failed to spot abuses within their own supply chains.
Time and again, we can see that campaigning bodies, or even journalists, out-perform auditors in uncovering abuse in supply chains. There are some advantages that the smaller bodies possess: they are nimble, more focused and, even though they are significantly smaller than their target, can commit more resources to the investigation. Large multinationals, who commonly manage over 100,000 suppliers, are overwhelmed by the scale of their own supply chains. Third-parties can hone in on one supplier and subject it to a level of scrutiny the corporation could never match.
This is the essential weakness of large companies. As multinationals' supply chains have bloated to ungovernable levels, they will be continually vulnerable accusations of abuse invisible to the corporation. Unless they commit the resources to match the NGOs and journalists, big companies will be easy prey for some time to come.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website. Jonathan WebbEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions"

                Wilmar launches landmark sustainable finance deal, child protection policy
            


The world’s largest palm oil trader has unveiled a series of sustainability initiatives. But some campaigners say it has failed to tackle the root causes of exploitation in its operations.

Dec. 1, 2017





In a world first for the palm oil industry, Singaporean agribusiness giant Wilmar International has reached an agreement with a financier that will allow it to pay lower interest rates on a loan if it meets sustainability-linked performance targets. 
The deal, announced on Monday, will see Wilmar working with Dutch bank ING to convert part of an existing US$150 million loan to a sustainability performance-linked one.
It is the first company in Asia, and the first palm oil company to work with ING to tie its financial obligations to its sustainability performance in this way. ING has inked similar sustainability performance-linked loans with clients such as a health technology company, a chocolate and cocoa producer and a gas and electricity company in Europe since March this year.
The announcement comes almost a year after international human rights group Amnesty International released a report outlining extensive labour abuses in Wilmar supplier plantations, including the use of child labour, unsafe conditions for workers which include exposure to toxic pesticide Paraquat, and a failure to pay minimum wage to workers. 
As part of its deal with ING, Wilmar will have to meet targets in various aspects of its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. These metrics are part of sustainability consultancy Sustainalytics’ research methodology for assessing the ESG rating of organisations.  
Metrics include the effectiveness of programmes around biodiversity, greenhouse gas reductions, renewable energy and sustainable agriculture. If Wilmar’s performance is satisfactory, ING will reduce the interest rate for part of the firm’s loan in 2018. Wilmar did not disclose figures for how much the interest rate would be cut by. 
Ho Kiam Kong, chief financial officer, Wilmar, said in a statement that “sustainability is a priority at Wilmar and we are constantly seeking improvements in our sustainability performance.”
“We believe that incorporating sustainability metrics into every aspect of our business, from daily operations to corporate financing, is key to creating value for our stakeholders,” added Ho. 
Perpetua George, general manager for group sustainability, Wilmar, told Eco-Business that in addition to its ongoing sustainability efforts, the company would be taking additional steps as part of its efforts to meet the Sustainalytics targets. These include improving the sustainability of other crops in Wilmar’s portfolio, such as sugar. 

“
We are actively working on plans to address this, but it’s not something that will change immediately. We cannot yet say we have successfully solved the wage issue.
Perpetua George, general manager for group sustainability, Wilmar International

Child protection policy
Wilmar’s sustainable finance deal comes close on the heels of a new policy to protect children living in the company’s oil palm plantations. 
Launched on November 22, the Child Protection Policy (CPP) takes a broader view to safeguarding the welfare of children than its existing No Child Labour Policy, which has been in place since the company’s inception.
The new CPP is applicable across Wilmar’s global operations, including its joint ventures, third-party suppliers, and contractors. Wilmar says this is the first such policy to apply explicitly to external parties. 
It includes commitments to protecting the interests and well-being of children in Wilmar’s operations and those who live in Wilmar concessions, providing children access to primary and secondary education, and responding to any reported abuses “swiftly and appropriately”. 
George said that “over the last year, we have received feedback from many organisations, principally Unicef, that rather than child labour per se, the bigger issue with children and the oil palm industry is about safeguarding children and their rights”. 
“We definitely agree with that and the CPP is conceived to ensure that we respect the rights and protect the welfare and wellbeing of children at all times,” she added. As part of the policy, Wilmar will be upgrading all the schools in and around its palm oil estates, and expects this to benefit as many as 7,000 children annually.
Ai Maryati Solihah, Commissioner of Trafficking and Exploitation, Indonesian Child Protection Commission, welcomed the effort and said in a statement that “I think this will have a positive impact on eliminating children’s involvement in Crude Palm Oil production”. But human rights campaigners were less impressed.
Lauren Armistead, business and human rights campaigner, Amnesty International, told Eco-Business: “We are really disappointed that this child protection policy isn’t more targeted. It doesn’t really address the root causes we identified in our report.” 
Amnesty’s report had explained that harvesters often had no choice but to bring their children to help out on plantations and work overtime, because it was the only way they could meet unreasonably high targets for fruit harvesting, and earn enough money to live on. 
“Without reforming the working policies and practices on plantations, and changing the wage and quota system, this policy could actually make working conditions harder for parents,” said Armistead. “It’s really about attacking the root causes.”
She also pointed out that Wilmar’s policy made no reference to any measures to remediate the physical and economic harm that had already been done to workers being exploited by suppliers. 
She added: “A lot of the abuses we highlighted—such as a failure to pay minimum wage to workers—were infringements of Indonesian and international law. Why it has taken a year to address this, we don’t know.” 
Amnesty International had in July this year also pointed out various omissions in an action plan developed by Wilmar in April, which sought to tackle labour violations in its operations.
The Wilmar document outlined commitments such as identifying why children did not attend school, educating parents on the hazards of having children on plantations, evaluating temporary workers for permanent roles, and educating workers on their healthcare entitlements.
But in a letter to Wilmar chief sustainability officer Jeremy Goon, Amnesty International head of business and human rights Seema Joshi pointed out various omissions: A failure to address issues such as penalties levied on workers and forced labour; no remediation for past harm suffered by workers; and a refusal to acknowledge structural issues such as unreasonably low salaries which forced workers to clock overtime hours.
“We have given really comprehensive feedback but it hasn’t been incorporated,” said Armistead.
In response, Wilmar’s George acknowledged that while the CPP’s intention was to look at children’s well-being in a more holistic manner across its operations, “it’s a fair point, and yes, the root cause of some of these issues is about wage structure.”
“But we are not saying that the policy is going to fix everything,” she said, adding that Wilmar is already working with global labour advocacy organisation Verite to address issues related to labour and wages in its supply chain. 
The issues identified by Amnesty International are rife in the whole industry, so solutions have to be broadly applicable, said George.  “We are actively working on plans to address this, but it’s not something that will change immediately,” said George. “We cannot yet say we have successfully solved the wage issue.”
She added that a series of supplier training workshops that Wilmar has recently initiated in partnership with advocacy group Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) will hopefully make it easier for suppliers to understand, and meet expectations on issues such as wages, labour conditions, and human rights.
Currently the workshops, which were announced in mid-November, aim to educate suppliers on the areas where they need to make improvements in their engagement with workers. Once that has been completed, Wilmar will move on to looking at the tools needed to make these changes, and how to measure their impact, said George.

Brands made by companies including Nestlé, Kellogg’s, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble may contain palm oil produced by children and workers sometimes paid less than $2.50 a day, a report by Amnesty International has claimed.The charity said it found “serious human rights abuses” on five palm oil plantations in Indonesia in the supply network of a company called Wilmar, which it said also supplies Proctor & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Reckitt Benckiser, renewable science company Elevance, and processing companies AFAMSA and ADM.The businesses have not confirmed which brands may have been made with palm oil farmed on the plantations, but among them they own a raft of household names.Amnesty is calling on the firms to reveal whether the palm oil in brands including Magnum, Colgate toothpaste, Dove cosmetics, KitKat, and Ariel come from Wilmar’s Indonesian operation.The report, The Great Palm Oil Scandal: Labour Abuses Behind Big Brand Names, claims to have uncovered “systematic” exploitation of workers during an investigation into sites owned by, or supplying, Wilmar, the world’s largest palm oil producer.Amnesty International said it traced palm oil from mills supplied by the plantations to seven of the companies. Procter & Gamble and Unilever, it said, confirmed they sourced palm oil from Wilmar and Indonesia but did not confirm which refineries they sourced it from.Amnesty said it found children as young as 8 working in sometimes ""hazardous conditions"" on the five plantations that it investigated.

Most of the children Amnesty identified worked after school and at weekends but some had left school in order to work full time.One 10-year-old child said he worked six days a week for the plantation, and had left school aged 8. A 14-year-old boy said he had also dropped out of school to help his unwell father to meet targets.The report also said the boy's two sisters, aged 12 and 10, work on the site after school, with work including carrying heavy sacks of palm fruit that weigh up to 25kg per bag.“It is difficult to carry it, it is heavy,” the boy is quoted as saying. ""I do it in the rain as well but it is difficult … My hands hurt and my body aches.""Workers were also found to be handling “highly toxic” chemicals and fertiliser meant only to be operated after specialist training. Protective equipment, the report said, was not properly maintained, leading to risks of respiratory damage and “severe injuries”.Amnesty also said women were routinely kept on insecure contracts and that workers were subjected to complex pay systems based on targets, leading to some workers earning below the minimum wage once deductions had been made.Many of the companies give on-pack assurances that they only use “sustainable” palm oil.Meghna Abraham, senior investigator at Amnesty International, said there was “nothing sustainable about palm oil that is produced using child labour and forced labour"".“The abuses discovered within Wilmar’s palm oil operations are not isolated incidents but are systemic,” she said.""Something is wrong when nine companies turning over a combined revenue of £260 billion in 2015 are unable to do anything about the atrocious treatment of palm oil workers earning a pittance.""She added: ""We think it's time to make all these companies accountable. They are promising you that the palm oil is sustainable – it's time that they actually made it sustainable.""In a letter to Wilmar, Amnesty International accused the company of having failed to “meet its responsibility to respect human rights"".Amnesty said it had also asked each company to confirm whether a list of their consumer products came from Wilmar’s Indonesian operations.BuzzFeed News reached out to all companies named in the report and asked them to respond to the allegations.Wilmar said that before Amnesty approached the company it had already been “made aware of the issues raised” and had “immediately embarked on an internal assessment"".A spokesperson shared its response letter, sent to Amnesty International, in which it says the issues raised were “systemic challenges shared by the industry” and that it was “committed” to addressing them.It also shared the results of its internal assessment, dated September 2016, with BuzzFeed News. The assessment lists “unfair payment of wages, child labour, discrimination of women and temporary workers, and handling of hazardous chemicals without personal protective equipment” as issues it is monitoring, with changes being implemented.In a statement, Unilever said it welcomed the report and that it agreed “much more” needed to be done to tackle “these deeply concerning social issues"".Colgate-Palmolive said it prohibited discrimination and child and forced labour in its supply chain and that it was “concerned” about the allegations.“We work with suppliers to remediate unacceptable practices and, as we have done in the past, will terminate any supplier that fails to address labor and human rights concerns,” a spokesman added.Kellogg’s said it was “committed to respecting human rights”, adding that where it found supply chain violations it would work with suppliers towards “corrective actions” and would “remove” those suppliers if concerns were not “adequately addressed"".A spokesman for Nestlé said Wilmar supplied 10% of its palm oil. “We will investigate allegations related to our purchasing of palm oil, along with our suppliers,” he said.He added that the company worked to “improve transparency, traceability and supplier behaviour in the palm oil industry” and had “processes in place to assess where the risk of labour or human rights violations exist in our supply chain”, which it was “taking action to address” these.“Where our suppliers fail to meet the provisions in our Supplier Code, including on labour rights, we will suspend them,” he said.ADM said: “We have committed to ... no exploitation in [our] palm supply chain. We work with our suppliers to ensure these policies are strictly followed. In the event that our suppliers do not comply with our protocols, we are committed to working with them to resolve such issues.""We look forward to working with Amnesty International and other organisations to discuss and address the concerns it has raised.”Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Elevance, and AFAMSA did not respond to requests for comment.

The great palm oil scandal: Labour abuses behind big brand names
Amnesty International, 2016

Posted on 01 Nov 2016





















This report investigates labour exploitation on plantations in Indonesia that provide palm oil to Wilmar, which is the world’s largest processor and merchandiser of palm and lauric (palm kernel) oils and controls over 43% of the global palm oil trade. The report also traces the palm oil produced in Indonesia for Wilmar to a range of consumer goods companies that use palm oil in their products. The investigation is based on both fieldwork in Indonesia and desk research. Researchers interviewed 120 plantation workers, including workers holding supervisory roles, on plantations directly owned by two Wilmar subsidiaries and on plantations owned by three companies that supply oil to Wilmar’s Indonesian refineries. The two Wilmar subsidiaries are PT Perkebunan Milano (PT Milano) and PT Daya Labuhan Indah. The three suppliers are PT Sarana Prima Multi Niaga (SPMN), PT Abdi Budi Mulia (ABM) and PT Hamparan Masawit Bangun Persada (PT Hamparan), part of the BEST Group, which supplies Wilmar. Wilmar, SPMN, and all but one of its buyers whom Amnesty International contacted, are members of the RSPO.
Amnesty International found serious human rights abuses on the plantations of Wilmar and its suppliers. These included forced labour and child labour, gender discrimination, as well as exploitative and dangerous working practices that put the health of workers at risk. The abuses identifed were not isolated incidents but due to systemic business practices by Wilmar’s subsidiaries and suppliers, in particular the low level of wages, the use of targets and ‘piece rates’ (where workers are paid based on tasks completed rather than hours worked), and the use of a complex system of fnancial and other penalties. Workers, especially women, are employed under casual work arrangements, which make them vulnerable to abuses.
